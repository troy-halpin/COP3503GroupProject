Our program is a personal banking software that allows users to manage their money in up to 3 accounts under a username and encrypted password. The program begins with the option to sign in, sign up, or exit the program. Users cannot make multiple passwords for the same username. The password must be a certain length (between 7 and 55 characters). After signing in, users have the option to check their balance(s), deposit and withdraw funds (in 11 different currencies), transfer funds between their accounts (if they have multiple accounts), add another account (limit at 3), switch accounts (if more than one), simulate interest gains over time on the current balance of an account, and log out (in which the user's information will be saved to a file).
